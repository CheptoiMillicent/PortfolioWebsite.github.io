Write a short document (in a text file or PDF) explaining your design choices, challenges faced, and how you addressed them.

Design Choice,
An opportunity to tell a story, though not fully but giving a glimpse, not as perfect as I imagined.
Challenges Faced,
Debugging.
Time allocated. 

How the challenges faced were addressed,
By using online websites, an example, the stalk overflow, that enabled to solve the various errors. The console log to determine where the errors are found.

The various errors encountered while making the portfolio as compared to the time allocated was quite a challenge. I did what I could with that specific duration.
